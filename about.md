I am an artist using modern technology to do creative things. I also enjoy making computers work on my behalf, and so I [automate things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_Piano_(novel)) when I can. I work in a cubicle by day making complicated things simple and simple things complicated, systematically forgetting how to do things by teaching computers to do them for me, and deftly avoiding boredom by getting things done. I maintain a comprehensive cultural and technical vision in order to effectively operationalize a diverse range of tactics to achieve strategic opportunities fostering objectives carefully aligned with my mission:

Be a servant leader using technology to enhance and improve the world.


### Geography

While I'm originally from northern California, I now live in the beautiful City of Sat. Louis, MO. I'm a passionate advocate for this community. Someday, I want to retire in outer space.

### Diet

I'm not a vegetarian, but I don't really eat meat, either. I eat a whole-plant based diet, avoiding animal proteins (especially the industrialized variet) when I can.
