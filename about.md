I am an artist using modern technology to do creative things. I also enjoy making computers work on my behalf, and so I [automate things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_Piano_(novel)) when I can. I work in a cubicle by day making complicated things simple and focusing on the complexities inherent in simple things, systematically forgetting how to do things by teaching computers to do them for me, and deftly avoiding boredom by getting things done. 

I envision a world in which advanced technology can assist humanity in creating a flourishing and just civilization in balance with nature that enriches our relationships with each other and our understanding and appreciation of the universe. I recognize that is not the world we have, but I am ready to do what I can to make it closer to that. I have developed a diverse range of technical, creative and social capabilities which I bring to my efforts to create a strategic impact on the world as it exists. By aligning the allocation of resources I have available with my objectives, I seek to advance specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound goals in service to *my personal mission:*
