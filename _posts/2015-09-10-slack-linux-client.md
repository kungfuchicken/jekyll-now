title: Slack Linux Client
---
I'm super excited about beta-testing the [Slack](https://slack.com/) desktop [app for Linux](https://slack.com/apps). I really like Slack (custom emoji should be a feature in EVERY tool). 

I've used the Mac desktop app recently with two teams, a conference and an art event, and it was great both times. I was using a Mac provided by my former employer, but I'm now using my own Linux laptop. The web app works well, but I tend to overload my browser with open tabs, and it's just nice to have a dedicated desktop app. 

Needless to say, I've got some teams I'm looking forward to using it with.
