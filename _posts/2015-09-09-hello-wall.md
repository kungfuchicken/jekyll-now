title: "Hello Wall!"
---
My highschool electronics teacher was quite a character. He had a calm and gentle demeanor, accompanied by a lilting Texas drawl (that was somewhat unique in this small northern California town). During one class in which everyone was working on small group projects, he was having trouble getting everyone's attention. All of a sudden, frustrated, he belted out loudly, "HELLO WALL!" 

Kudos to Mr. Kaufmann for an instant commedy classic to our immature sensibilities.
